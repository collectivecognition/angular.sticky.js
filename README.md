Uses `position: relative` to provide wider browser compatibility and maintain the sticky element's place in the DOM, but this may not work as expected in all situations.

Usage:
======

    <element sticky>

Customizing:
============

Adds a `.sticky` classname to all 'stuck' elements to allow customizing their look (adding padding, changing background colors, modifying z-index, etc..).
